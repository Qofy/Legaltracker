# Example environment variables for frontend
# If your backend socket server runs on a different host/port, set VITE_SOCKET_URL
# Example (uncomment and edit to match your backend):
# VITE_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:3001"

# If your socket server requires authentication via token in the handshake,
# the client will attach `auth: { token }` when `initSocket(token)` is called.
# Ensure the backend reads `socket.handshake.auth.token` and validates it.

# Other Vite env vars can be added here as needed.
